# General
I want to include Hoenn, Johto and Kanto in this romhack. 

First we start in Hoenn. I want to make a simplified/alternative version of Hoenn: shorter and simplified routes with custom encounters.

Then Johto and Kanto could be traversed in a similar fashion as in Pokémon GoldSilver (beat Johto and then get sent to Kanto)

A connection idea is adding the electrotrain to Malvalona city that allows the player to travel to Johto.

# Silver
 Original lines https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Silver_(game)/Quotes
 He is keeping character from GS -> only interested in strong Pokemon although it can be seen that in HeartGold/SoulSilver he kind of changes his mind by the end of the game and start treating his Pokemon better.

 In this Romhack I want to show regression on his character and so he is still only interested in strong Pokemon. He treated his Pokemon with love and respect but he still could not beat Gold, which is torturing him. Gold is standing in the way of Silver to become the World's strongest Pokemon trainer.

 Silver abandoned his Pokemon from Johto because he could not defeat Gold with them and has started a journey looking for stronger ones. This is also an excuse to make Silver start from scratch with low level Pokemon which can fight the Player in a fair battle.

First appearance in Hoenn Route 104.

Enemy with the team Rocket

### Route 104
#### Intro
> I wonder if there are any strong Pokémon around here...
##### Notices player
> What are you looking at?
> Oh, you are a trainer? Let me see how strong you are!
Suggestion:
> Tch… Another trainer? Let's see if you're worth anything.
##### Defeat InBattle
> Damn it! My Pokémon are so weak.
##### Defeat InOverworld
> I used to have strong Pokémon. I tried trusting them and treating them with love but they still couldn't defeat him.
> I gave up on them and since them I have been looking for stronger ones.
> I'll keep searching. One day I will be the world's greatest Pokémon trainer!
> We'll meet again.
Suggestion:
> I used to have strong Pokémon. I tried trusting them, being kind... 
But it didn't matter, they still couldn’t beat him.
So I gave up on them. Now I only want power.
One day, I'll be the world's greatest Pokémon Trainer.
We'll meet again.

#### Others
> ...You remind me of him

# Norman

Hasn't seen Brendan for a long time and is afflicted by it. He mistakes the player for his son so he gets excited for a second but then realizes it is not his son. Also implies that mother is missing or dead. The player house is empty in Littleroot so that is also another hint to the player.

Note: Would be good to adapt to player gender (e.g. Misses May instead of Brendan if player is female) though for now I think it is not worth the effort

#### Meeting for the first time
> "Welcome to Petalburg gym"

> "..."

> "...Is it ...you?"

> "Oh! son! I have missed you so much! It has been so long!

> "Where have you been? What have you been up to?

> "Since you became the Champion we haven't heard anything about you"

> "How long has it been since then?"

> "Listen... your Mom... I..."

> "..."

> "Don't worry. Now that you are back everything will be okay."

*steps back while facing player*

> "..."

> "..."

*steps towards the player*

> "You are not my son, are you?"

> "..."

> "..."
* steps back and faces away the player
> "Forget what I said, it does not matter..."
> "I can see that you do not have any medals. Come back once you have four of them".

#### Coming back with four medals

#### Rematch
* A trainer is in the gym instead of Norman
> "Hello challenger."
> "I am the new leader of the Petalburg gym"
> "The previous leader left without giving any explanation but left its Pokémon behind"
