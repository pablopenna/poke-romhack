# General
The game takes place in a surreal, dreamlike world — a representation of Limbo, where the protagonist exists while in a coma following an implied suicide attempt. This world is a mental construct, an escape into the familiar comfort of Pokémon — a deeply nostalgic space tied to the protagonist's past, memories, and emotional recovery.

Though the setting feels familiar with original visuals, music, and characters from the early Pokémon games, the tone is more introspective, occasionally unsettling, and emotionally layered.

The game begins in an empty room with three Poké Balls. You must choose one to proceed. You’re not allowed to leave without doing so, hinting at the idea of “choosing a path.”

This room later becomes a hub, serving as a safe space to heal Pokémon, access a PC, and potentially travel between regions.

You start in a version of Hoenn, beginning in Littleroot — but it is subtly off. Familiar houses and signs remain, but some locations (like the rival’s house) are closed. NPCs give cryptic or emotionally distant dialogue, and signs seem like relics from a past life. A strange statue exudes a mysterious energy. There's an ongoing sense that something is missing — a forgotten past or broken connection.

# Trainers

## Silver
 Original lines https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Silver_(game)/Quotes
 He is keeping character from GS -> only interested in strong Pokemon although it can be seen that in HeartGold/SoulSilver he kind of changes his mind by the end of the game and start treating his Pokemon better.

 In this Romhack I want to show regression on his character and so he is still only interested in strong Pokemon. He treated his Pokemon with love and respect but he still could not beat Gold, which is torturing him. Gold is standing in the way of Silver to become the World's strongest Pokemon trainer.

 Silver abandoned his Pokemon from Johto because he could not defeat Gold with them and has started a journey looking for stronger ones. This is also an excuse to make Silver start from scratch with low level Pokemon which can fight the Player in a fair battle.

First appearance in Hoenn Route 104.

He is enemies with the team Rocket. According to the wiki, Silver battles team Rocket because they are weak. Giovanni is his father so I could introduce some son-father hate as motivation if that is not already implied in the canon plot.

> Giovanni and Silver's relationship is first alluded to in Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, when Team Rocket Scientist Gideon at the Rocket Warehouse on Five Island asks the player if they are "Giovanni's kid", but concludes they're not, saying that "Giovanni's kid has red hair." Their relationship is officially confirmed in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, where bringing a fateful encounter Celebi to the Ilex Forest shrine causes the player to travel three years into the past, allowing them to witness Giovanni abandoning Silver to go into seclusion after his defeat at the hands of Red. Silver's hate for Team Rocket apparently stems from the failure of his father, hating how he's brave only when surrounded by his followers and swearing to become strong all on his own.

As character development, I have thought about making Silver to realize that it is him actually the weak one, not his Pokemon and that it was his fault when he lost against Gold or Lance.

Final Arc vs Team Rocket Silver will be at death risk by an attack of a Team Rocket 's Pokemon. Feraligatr, the Pokemon he originally chose, will save him by standing before him and taking the attack. As a result, Feraligatr will perish. This will make Silver feel powerless as Feraligatr died because of him and there was nothing he could do. Realizing that the weak one was him, not his Pokémon all along

### Route 104
#### Intro
> I wonder if there are any strong Pokémon around here...
##### Notices player
> What are you looking at?
> Oh, you are a trainer? Let me see how strong you are!
Suggestion:
> Tch… Another trainer? Let's see if you're worth anything.
##### Defeat InBattle
> Damn it! My Pokémon are so weak.
##### Defeat InOverworld
> I used to have strong Pokémon. I tried trusting them and treating them with love but they still couldn't defeat him.
> I gave up on them and since them I have been looking for stronger ones.
> I'll keep searching. One day I will be the world's greatest Pokémon trainer!
> We'll meet again.
Suggestion:
> I used to have strong Pokémon. I tried trusting them, being kind... 
But it didn't matter, they still couldn’t beat him.
So I gave up on them. Now I only want power.
One day, I'll be the world's greatest Pokémon Trainer.
We'll meet again.

#### Others
> ...You remind me of him



## Team Rocket
After Team Aqua and Magma dissolved and due to improvements in communication between Hoenn and Johto/Kanto, the Team Rocket has expanded to Hoenn.

They heard of the legends of Pokemon that have powers over the earth and seas and want to capture them and use them to their advantage to gain money and power.

## Team Magma and Aqua
Defend important places from Team Rocket in Hoenn. After their actions in Ruby & Sapphire, 
they feel guilty for what they did to the region and its people and take responsibility on 
trying to prevent their past mistakes from happening again.


## Norman

Hasn't seen Brendan for a long time and is afflicted by it. He mistakes the player for his son so he gets excited for a second but then realizes it is not his son. Also implies that mother is missing or dead. The player house is empty in Littleroot so that is also another hint to the player.

Note: Would be good to adapt to player gender (e.g. Misses May instead of Brendan if player is female) though for now I think it is not worth the effort

#### Meeting for the first time
> "Welcome to Petalburg gym"

> "..."

> "...Is it ...you?"

> "Oh! son! I have missed you so much! It has been so long!

> "Where have you been? What have you been up to?

> "Since you became the Champion we haven't heard anything about you"

> "How long has it been since then?"

> "Listen... your Mom... I..."

> "..."

> "Don't worry. Now that you are back everything will be okay."

*steps back while facing player*

> "..."

> "..."

*steps towards the player*

> "You are not my son, are you?"

> "..."

> "..."
* steps back and faces away the player
> "Forget what I said, it does not matter..."
> "I can see that you do not have any medals. Come back once you have four of them".

#### Coming back with four medals

#### Rematch
* A trainer is in the gym instead of Norman
> "Hello challenger."
> "I am the new leader of the Petalburg gym"
> "The previous leader left without giving any explanation but left its Pokémon behind"

## Kiyo/Koichi (Kanto Dojo Master)
https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Fighting_Dojo

There is confusion wether he is Koichi or Kiyo. 
https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Koichi
https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kiyo

Training in Dewford with Brawly. When player arrives at Dewford, he sees Koichi leaving.
Koichi notices the player and talks to him. Notices that he is a trainer but not strong enough
to battle him yet, though he can feel a strong potential in the player. He then tells the player 
that maybe he can visit him at his Dojo in Kanto once he is stronger.

# Places

I want to include Hoenn, Johto and Kanto in this romhack. 

The setting for all of them will be after all their respective games

First we start in Hoenn. I want to make a simplified/alternative version of Hoenn: shorter and simplified routes with custom encounters.

Then Johto and Kanto could be traversed in a similar fashion as in Pokémon GoldSilver (beat Johto and then get sent to Kanto)

A connection idea is adding the magnettrain to Mauville city that allows the player to travel to Johto.

## Hoenn
https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hoenn

### Littleroot

#### Buildings
The Pokemon Lab is not the Pokemon lab anymore. When entering, it leads to the empty room where the player starts.

The house of the player is the one on the right. The inside is an exact copy but there is nobody inside. The player cannot proceed to Route 101 until they set the clock in their room. I want to force the player to set it to avoid posible bugs that may steem if the game internal clock is not set.

Rival's house, the one on the left is closed.

### Dewford

Modified to be more rocky like. Now it is surrounded by rocks rather than having a single cave to the west.
This is because of the fight aftermath between the Groudon vs Kyogre which caused earthquakes can 
caused the landscape around Dewford to change.

### Mauville

Technological hub of Hoenn. Thanks to all the power obtained from its power facilities, it has been 
able to develop and build the magnettrain.
